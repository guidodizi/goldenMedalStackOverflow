Want to look like a _pro_ on StackOverflow but you are too stupid to answer any difficult question so as to get enough upvotes?

Wanna do things the fun way? _Hacking_ your way in?

You came into the right place

## üôè Disclaimer
I've always been dazzled by how the developer community has always come together and shared knowledge without any direct benefit. I believe this was a key factor for striving and accomplishing all the community has achieved.

By no means does this repository tend to inflict this achievement, but rather share a fun personal experience to automate a mundane task such as logging in for 100 days straight.

## ‚èÆÔ∏è Prerequisits
